## Instructions for Playing the Game

Use your arrow keys to move the player. Try to avoid the enemies! If you collide with an enemy, there will be a short delay and then your player will be moved back to the starting point. If you make it to the water, you win! Keep hitting the up arrow key until you see the popup alert window notifying you that you won the game (getting to the edge of the water is not enough). Once you click OK in the popup window, you will be sent back to the beginning and the game will start over again. 

## Prerequisites
None! If you simply drag the index.html file into a browser this should work. This works best with Google Chrome though.

## Installation/Instructions for Running the Game
Download the files and unzip them onto your computer. Drag the index.html file into a Google Chrome browser. That's it!

## Dependencies

None.

## Resources

No additional resources, just object-oriented JavaScript.
